        1) User must have at least basic knowledge about commands for Chanserv,Nickserv and Memoserv (Without relying much on IRC scripts). You may refer to https://freenode.net/kb/all
        2) Be active in the main channel so existing channel operators can get to know you.
        3) We still maintain the legacy procedure for new AOP, whereby the result depends solely on the votes from the existing AOP.
        4) Existing AOP must vote for your nickname by sending the memo to the existing channel operators.
        5) You will be added as the new AOP, if existing channel operators have no objections against it.
            a) The timeframe for existing channel operators to vote is 2 weeks.
            b) You will be added as trial for 2 weeks.
        6) If any channel operators denied your vote (with or without reason), your vote will automatically be terminated but you can apply again after a while.
        7) Previous channel operators who rejoins IRC after a long period of inactiveness will automatically be added after a few verifications by existing channel operators.
